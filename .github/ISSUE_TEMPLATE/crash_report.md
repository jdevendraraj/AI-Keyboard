  or reproducible.
- Please search existing bug/crash reports to avoid creating duplicates.
- Give your crash report a good name (no generics like "Error" or "Crash"), so
  others can easily identify the topic of your issue.

             don't submit this bug report and check out issue #677 (is pinned).
